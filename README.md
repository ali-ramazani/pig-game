# Pig Game

## About the Game

Pig is a simple and entertaining dice game. The rules are easy to learn and the gameplay is quick, making it a perfect choice for a fun gaming session.

### How to Play

1. **Roll the Dice**: In each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
2. **Scoring**: 
   - If a player rolls a 1, they don't score any points and it becomes the next player's turn.
   - If the player rolls another number, it is added to their turn total and their turn continues.
3. **Winning**: The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
